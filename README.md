# 0x0B. Unity - VR Room
## Resources :books:
* [The Science of Locomotion in VR]()
* [Movement in VR]()
* [Game Design Deep Dive: Making VR movement feel like a superpower]()
* [Why AR/VR developers should prioritize accessibility in UI / UX Design]()
* [Unity Manual: Introduction to VR Best Practices]()
* [Unity Manual: Understanding optimization in Unity]()
* [Unity Manual]()
* [UI / UX in AR / VR]()
## Learning Objectives :bulb:
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:  
* What are the different types of locomotion / movement in VR
* What causes VR motion sickness
* What are the different methods of minimizing VR motion sickness in locomotion implementations
* How to implement a teleportation method of movement in VR
* How to implement interactive objects in VR
## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your 0x0B-unity-vr_room directory
* This project should be uploaded to its own repo named 0x0B-unity-vr_room
* Scenes and project assets such as Scripts must be organized as described in the tasks
* In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
## Tasks
### Mandatory :page_with_curl:
- [x] **[0. You ever wonder why we're here](./Assets/)** - In this project, you will be creating a sitting / standing VR experience in the form of a simple exploration (mandatory tasks) or “escape room”-style game (advanced tasks)
- [x] **[1. Instant transmission](./Assets/)** - Implement the “teleportation” method of movement so that the user can use the controller to indicate where they want to move and move there on button press
- [x] **[2. Object oriented](./Assets/*)** - Create interaction that allows an object to be picked up and/or interacted with by the controller(s). How you implement the interaction may be determined by the VR headset / controller you are targeting, but always keep the user in mind and make their experience as smooth and intuitive as possible
- [x] **[3. Let the right one in](./Assets/)** - Script interaction in the scene so that the door opens with an animation when the user interacts with it
- [x] **[4. An "on" button would have sufficed](./Assets/)** - Script interaction in the scene so that the projector in the center of the second room turns on when the user interacts with it
- [x] **[5. We didn't really escape though](./Assets/)** - Create a build of the tour
### Advance :muscle:
- [x] **[6. Doors should not be this hard to open](./Assets/)** - Scenes in Build
- [x] **[7. Astro projection](./Assets/)** - Script interaction in the scene so that the user must interact with at least four objects before the projector in the center of the second room turns on
